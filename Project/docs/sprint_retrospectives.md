# ⭐ Sprint 1 Retrospective

## What Went Well
- Established the tech stack (Flask + React).
- Created initial project structure.
- Completed authentication design and core requirements documents.
- Collaborated effectively through GitLab and team meetings.

## What Didn’t Go Well
- We misunderstood sprint expectations and grouped too many tasks into Sprint 1.
- Documentation was created late instead of during the sprint.
- Stories were too large and not broken into weekly deliverables.

## Improvements
- Split work into smaller, manageable user stories.
- Set clearer goals for each sprint.
- Update issue board weekly instead of retroactively.

# ⭐ Sprint 2 Retrospective

## What Went Well
- Completed Login and Signup implementation.
- Established connection between frontend and backend.
- Improved code structure in both React and Flask.
- Team coordination improved significantly.

## What Didn’t Go Well
- Sprint 2 was not evaluated at the correct time due to timeline confusion.
- Some tasks spilled over into Sprint 3.
- Testing coverage lagged behind implementation.

## Improvements
- Commit smaller, more frequent increments.
- Keep issue labels and boards continuously updated.
- Begin writing tests earlier in the sprint.

# ⭐ Sprint 3 Retrospective

## What Went Well
- Completed Lost Items page functionality.
- Implemented staff portal features.
- Backend–frontend synchronization now stable.
- Achieved final working version of major app features.

## What Didn’t Go Well
- Sprint 3 was evaluated before Sprint 1 and 2 due to board organization issues.
- A few tasks were still too large and required splitting mid-sprint.
- Team had to rush some documentation.

## Improvements
- Use consistent milestone planning.
- Ensure sprint goals are locked at start.
- Maintain clear communication with lab instructors regarding evaluations.

# ⭐ Sprint 4 Retrospective

## What Went Well
- Completed all core Sprint 4 functionality, including user authentication fixes and UI improvements.
- Integrated backend and frontend changes successfully.
- Added user manual and documentation for completed features.
- Team coordination and sprint planning improved; tasks were tracked more consistently.

## What Didn’t Go Well
- Some minor merge conflicts delayed integration of certain features.
- Testing coverage lagged slightly behind implementation for some edge cases.
- A few issues were underestimated in effort, causing last-minute adjustments.

## Improvements
- Continue breaking tasks into smaller subtasks to prevent overruns.
- Write automated tests in parallel with implementation.
- Allocate dedicated time for integration to reduce merge conflicts.

# ⭐ Sprint 5 Retrospective

## What Went Well
- Finalized remaining features and bug fixes.
- Completed final project video demo and presentation slides.
- Conducted comprehensive QA testing and validation of all features.
- Team followed more consistent commit and Git hygiene practices.

## What Didn’t Go Well
- Pressure from final delivery caused some tasks to be rushed.
- Minor UI inconsistencies required last-minute adjustments.
- Limited time for deep performance optimization.

## Improvements
- Start final sprint preparations earlier to reduce end-of-project stress.
- Maintain thorough documentation updates in real-time.
- Schedule review sessions to catch UI and performance issues sooner.

# ⭐ Overall Project Retrospective

## Key Takeaways
- Consistent team communication and use of GitLab Issue Boards significantly improved productivity.
- Breaking tasks into smaller, trackable user stories helped maintain progress visibility.
- Integrating frontend and backend early in each sprint minimized integration issues.

## Recommendations for Future Projects
- Allocate dedicated testing time for each sprint rather than leaving QA to the end.
- Continue using retrospective notes to improve sprint planning and issue estimation.
- Maintain detailed documentation and user manuals incrementally throughout the project.
